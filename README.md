# Textlytics [in progress]
I am developing a complete end-to-end Natural Language Processing solution incorporating various text-based analytical features.

Work done so far:

1. Built a language translator using Facebook's M2M100 that translates uploaded files. The model can interpret the following languages: 'English' ('en'), 'Spanish' ('es'), 'French' ('fr'), 'German' ('de'), 'Italian' ('it'), 'Chinese' ('zh'), 'Japanese' ('ja'), 'Russian' ('ru'), 'Hindi' ('hi').
2. The model is accessed through a ReactJS-based web app hosted on a Flask server.
